#  Javascript Challenge : "Data Visualisation"


## The mission :

##### For example I work in the Multimedia department of one of the institutions of the European Union. This morning, my project manager sent me on a mission: one of the internal journalists published a new article on the institution's website. The article in question is already integrated into an html / css / Javascript file.

##### He asks me to make him richer, more interactive, more ... sexy.
  ### The objective:
  ##### is to insert a graphic above each table, transform the tables into JSON after putting them in API in addition to calling them in AJAX.
